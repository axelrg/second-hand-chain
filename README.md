# UBU-SecondHandChain

## Description
Second Hand Chain is a decentralized application (dApp) that uses blockchain technology to create a secure marketplace for trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing real-world smartphones. Each NFT represents a unique smartphone with its features and ownership history, acting as a digital certificate of authenticity. The platform aims to provide transparency and efficiency in buying and selling pre-owned smartphones by tokenizing them as NFTs on the blockchain.
